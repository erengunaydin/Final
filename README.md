# Musci Bot
For my final project I decided to create a discord music bot.

I decided to create this bot because discord is activly trying to get rid of every single discord music bot. Why they do this I don't know. But, I knew I needed to do something because my friends and I love listening to music together on discord. So this gave me the idea just to host my own.

This was not gonna be an easy task however. I went into this thinking that the process would be simple but I was very wrong. Even following youtube tutorials I was constantly making mistakes and getting errors. One big problem I had at the start was FFmpeg not working at all and always giving me errors when trying to run my bot. I had to look up more videos for that and figured out that I had to include it on a path in my PC. Then another problem I had was just not having some of the directories downloaded. By the time I realized it had already been an hour. I was battling my own self from making errors. Once I got past the first steps however started to go smoothly. My bot finally started to play music and I could add the commands that I needed. I added play, pause, resume, stop, queue, and other different commands that brought the bot to life. The bot was playing music and all was well. Then my bot decided to just break randomly and make the queue function stop working entirely. That took even more time to figure out and it came down to just one line of code. 

Overall, I loved this project. It taught me a lot about the discord bot developing process and it got me to do something that I wanted to do for a long time. I plan to host this bot 24/7 so that me and my friends can still use it. I also didn't really get all the features that I wanted to add but I plan on adding some later on my own time.
