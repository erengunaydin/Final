# Musci Bot
Video - 

For my final project, I decided to create a Discord music bot.

I decided to create this bot because Discord is actively trying to get rid of every single Discord music bot. Why they must do this, I don't know. But, I knew I needed to do something because my friends and I love listening to music together on Discord. So, this gave me the idea to make my own.

This was not going to be an easy task, however. I went into this thinking that the process would be simple, but I was very wrong. Even following YouTube tutorials, I was constantly making mistakes and getting errors. One big problem I had at the start was FFmpeg not working at all and always giving me errors when trying to run my bot. I had to look up more videos for that and figured out that I had to include it in the path on my PC. Then, another problem I had was just not having some of the directories downloaded. By the time I realized it, an hour had already passed. I was battling my own mistakes and they were stupid ones. Once I got past the first steps, however, things started to go smoothly. My bot finally started to play music, and I could add the commands that I needed. I added play, pause, resume, stop, queue, and other different commands that brought the bot to life. The bot was playing music, and all was well. Then, my bot decided to just break randomly and make the queue function stop working entirely. That took even more time to figure out, and it came down to just a few lines of code.

Overall, I loved this project. It taught me a lot about the Discord bot development process, and it got me to do something that I had wanted to do for a long time. I plan to host this bot 24/7 so that my friends and I can still use it. I also didnâ€™t get all the features I wanted to add due to time, but I plan on adding some later on my own time.

Here are the videos that helped me a lot when making my bot:
