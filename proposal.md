# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Melody Music Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will create a discord music bot that takes songs from youtube and plays it in your discord server.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My bot will play music for any discord server. It will have a play, pause, and stop feature. I also plan to add more access to different platforms like youtube, soundcloud, spotify, etc. I will also make it so that you can play livestreams or podcasts from different platforms. I also will make it so playlists can be used and I want to figure out a way to make playlists within the bot.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not planning on doing that.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Nope

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will make sure that my bot at least plays music within a discord server.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to make sure that I add some of the features that were listed in the paragraph above.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to make sure I add all of the features above and maybe even more.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Well first I need to figure out how to actually code a discord bot. I will use my resources like youtube to help me get started. I then will research the discord apis and figure out that works. I also have to research how to pull youtube videos and make the music play on discord. It's gonna take some time to learn the skills needed but it will be worth it in the end.
